changes for neutron:

---------------------------------------------change play order:

(if ("SameTurn")
                    (forEach Piece "Neutron"
                        ("MovePiece")
                        Shared
                    )
                    (forEach Piece "Disc"
                        ("MovePiece")
                        (then
                            (moveAgain)
                        )
                    )
                )

---------------------------------------------have both playing all rounds:

   remove (if (= (count Moves) 0)

---------------------------------------------choose only one to play in each round:

(or
                (forEach Piece "Disc"
                    ("MovePiece")
                )
                (forEach Piece "Neutron"
                    ("MovePiece")
                    Shared
                )
            )


----------------------------------------------change the movement of the pieces:

- direction: page 128 of referecence - add Diagonal/Orthogonal after move Slide
- distance: 

(move Slide (between (max/exact 2))
        (to
            (sites Empty)
        )
    )

(move Slide (between (max 2))
        (to
            (sites Empty)
            (apply
                if:(or {
                    (is In 
                        (ahead (to) steps:1 (directions Cell from:(from) to:(to)))
                        (sites Occupied by:All)
                    )
                    (= (ahead (to) steps:1 (directions Cell from:(from) to:(to))) (to))
                    (and {(is Empty (to)) (= (count Steps (from) (to)) 2)})
                })
            )
        )
    )

// stay in place or move
(define "MoveNeutron"
    (or {
    (move Slide Diagonal
        (to
            (sites Empty)
            (apply
                if:(or {
                    (is In 
                        (ahead (to) steps:1 (directions Cell from:(from) to:(to)))
                        (sites Occupied by:All)
                    )
                    (= (ahead (to) steps:1 (directions Cell from:(from) to:(to))) (to))
                })
            )
        )
    )
    (move Select (from) (to (sites Occupied by:All) if:(= (count Steps (from) (to)) 0)))
    })
)

(move Pass)

----------------------------------------------change number of pieces and positions:

- numbers start at bottom and from 0
- array without virgula

----------------------------------------------add obstacles in the board:

(define "SymRemover" // Rotation, board, cells or vertices to remove 
    (renumber (rotate (* (- #1 1) (/ 360 #1)) (trim (remove #2 #3))))
)

(board
            ("SymRemover" 1 
                ((square 5))
                cells:{5 6 7 8}
            )
            use:Cell
        )

---------------------------------------------random placing of a piece:

(place Random (sites {5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19}) {"Neutron"})

(place Random (sites {0 1 2 3 4}) {"Disc2"})
(place "Disc1" (sites Bottom))


---------------------------------------------turns alternadas entre neutron e as outras pieces:

(if (is Even (/ (count Moves) 2))
                (forEach Piece "Disc"
                    ("MovePiece")
                )
                (forEach Piece "Neutron"
                    ("MovePiece")
                    Shared
                )
            )

---------------------------------------------only play piece on more than one turn

(or {(= (count Moves) 0) (= (count Moves) 1)} )


---------------------------------------------win if player moves a piece to a particular spot in board

(if (and ((is In (where "Neutron" Shared) (sites {12})) (is Mover P1))) 
                (result P1 Win)
            )

page 128

-----------------------remove a piece:



-----------------------add some kind of score:

(then
                            (and 
                            ((if (is In (where "Neutron" Shared) (sites {0 1 3 4}))
                                (addScore P1 1)
                            ))
                            (moveAgain)
                            )
                        )


(if (= 2 (score P1)) (byScore))
